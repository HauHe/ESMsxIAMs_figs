# Variable plots
In these pages you can find the plots for all variables across resolutions from the paper _The mutual benefits of comparing Energy System Models and Integrated Assessment Models_.

The plots are sorted into the following categories:

* [Emissions](emissions.md)
* [Demands](demands.md)
* [Primary Energy](primary_energy.md)
* [Electricity Supply](electricity_supply.md)
* [Heat](heat.md)
* [Hydrogen](hydrogen.md)

The source code to generate the figures is available in the GitHub repository [ESMsxIAMs](https://github.com/HauHe/ESMsxIAMs).
